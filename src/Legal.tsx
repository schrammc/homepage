                <h3>Liability for Content</h3>

                As a service provider, I am responsible for my own content on
                these pages in accordance with Section 7, Paragraph 1 of the TMG
                (German Telemedia Act), under general laws. However, pursuant to
                Sections 8 to 10 of the TMG, I as a service provider am not
                obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party
                information or to investigate circumstances that indicate
                illegal activity.  Obligations to remove or block the use of
                information under general laws remain unaffected by
                this. However, liability in this regard is only possible from
                the time of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon
                notification of such violations, I will remove this content
                immediately.

                <h3>Liability for Links</h3>

                My page contains links to external third-party websites, over
                whose contents I have no influence. Therefore, I do assume any
                liability for this external content. The respective provider or
                operator of the pages is always responsible for the contents of
                the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible
                legal infringements at the time of linking. Illegal content was
                not recognizable to me at the time of linking. However, a
                permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable
                without concrete evidence of infringement.  Upon notification of
                a violation, I will remove the problematic link immediately.

                <h3>Copyright</h3>

                The content and works created on these pages is subject to
                German copyright law. The duplication, processing, distribution,
                and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright
                require the written consent of the respective author or
                creator. Downloads and copies of this page are only permitted
                for private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this
                page was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third
                parties are respected.  In particular, third-party content is
                identified as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a
                copyright infringement, I ask for prompt notification.
